# Simple Express.js Server
This is a simple Express.js server that receives requests and process them. Demonstrates basic Express.js request handling and routing. Makes use of the npm packages `express` and `nodemon`.

Extract files to a directory, then run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Run the app using `npm start`, then naviagte to `localhost:3000` to view the app. You can toggle comments on middleware functions and save your changes; nodemon should automatically restart the server once changes are detected. Routed urls are `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3000/users` (second part of assignment only).
